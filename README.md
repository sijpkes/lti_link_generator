# LTI Link Generator #
### Project Goal: ###

A Web application that generates LTI links to existing learning tools housed in an ExpressionEngine(EE) install. Allows editing of existing templates in EE by the user.  

The product should be a scalable web application that can be extended to add any tools developed for the LTI Module below. This means being able to select any tool from a drop down menu and having custom settings displayed for each tool loaded from the mySQL database.
